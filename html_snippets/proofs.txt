<h1>Proofs</h1>

<p>
ben-jose can generate proofs for unsatisfiable formulas. 

<p>
Assuming the program ''bj-batch-solver'' is in the path, and from the source tree directory:

<pre>
	cd ben-jose-master/src/programs/tests/solver
	sh clean_sh
	bj-solver-debug ./h4.cnf -proof -root .
	firefox ./SKELETON/CNF/Show_Proof.htm &
</pre>

<p>
the bj-batch-solver program will use the bjp_write_proofs library option to generate the proof of the unsatisfiable instance ''h4.cnf'' in JSON format. 

<p>
Then:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Copy the (very long) path printed in the standard output under "LAST_PROOF_PATH=" to the text area field in the Show_Proof.htm HTML page.

<p>
Paths must begin with ''/SKELETON'', so get rid of the prefix before it.

<li>
Click ''LOAD\_FILE''
</ol>
