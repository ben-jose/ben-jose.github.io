<h1>Proofs</h1>

<p>
ben-jose can generate proofs for unsatisfiable formulas. To display them you will need a file system web browser like 
webfs.

<p>
This display system was designed as a debug tool so it needs some steps to be used.
Also while running it will show some dialogs. Just click ok to all of them.

<p> To install webfs in Linux Mint just type:
<pre>
	sudo apt-get install webfs
</pre>

<p>
Assuming the program ''bj-batch-solver'' is in the path, and from the source tree directory:

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Due to a bug in the last solver version you must first edit the file 'dbg_ben_jose.conf' and uncomment (delete the leading '//')
in the line that starts with '//115' so that you can see the paths that you will need later.
</div>

<pre>
	cd ben-jose-master/src/programs/tests/solver
	sh clean_sh
	bj-solver-debug ./h4.cnf -proof -root .
	webfsd -F -p 3000
</pre>

And from another terminal:

<pre>
	firefox http://localhost:3000/SKELETON/CNF/Show_Proof.htm &
</pre>

<p>
The expected output can be found in <a href="proof_h4/SKELETON/CNF/Show_Proof.htm">this link</a>.

<p>
the bj-batch-solver program will use the bjp_write_proofs library option to generate the proof of the unsatisfiable instance ''h4.cnf'' in JSON format. 

<p>
Then:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Copy the (very long) path printed in the standard output under "FINAL_PROOF_JSN=" to the text area field in the Show_Proof.htm HTML page. (This will NOT be displayed in stdout if you did not uncomment the line starting with '//115' in the 'dbg_ben_jose.conf' file).

<p>
Paths must begin with ''/SKELETON'', so get rid of the prefix before it.

<li>
Click ''LOAD\_FILE''
</ol>
