\subsection{Detailed Description}
The initial and final state for an stabilization is a coloring. 

A color is just an integer. A coloring of a sub-\/formula is an assignation of an integer (\hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} -\/ color) to each \hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} and an integer (\hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} -\/color) to each \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} of the sub-\/formula. An stabilization may start with all neurons having the same neuron-\/color and all \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} s having the same \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} -\/color and finalize with each \hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} having a unique \hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} -\/ color and each \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} having a unique \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} -\/color, called a complete coloring.

colorings are ''loaded'' into the sortglb class in order to start stabilization. After stabilization the final coloring may be ''saved''. Each color in a coloring will correspond to one \hyperlink{classsorset}{sorset} during stabilization. These ''loading'' and ''saving'' words are used in the software only in relation to the sortglb class and have nothing to do with file operations.

This class is used to specify only the input to the stabilization process (the initial state). The class \hyperlink{classcanon__cnf}{canon\+\_\+cnf} is used for the output (it is the result of applying the output coloring (stabilized coloring) to the sub-\/formula it defines\+: \hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} s and \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} s in the coloring. To initialize the sortor, it ''loads'' the initial coloring into the sortglb instance that will stabilize the C\+N\+F sub-\/formula.
