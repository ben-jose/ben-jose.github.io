\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class for representing B\+CP propagation data. 

Which \hyperlink{classquanton}{quanton} fired by which \hyperlink{classneuron}{neuron} (which clause forced a given variable). B\+CP is done with the two watched literals technique (two watched fibres in the library\textquotesingle{}s terminology).
